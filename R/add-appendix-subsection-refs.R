#' Post process appendix subsections in LaTeX code
#'
#' @description
#' A post-processor to modify the appendix subsection LaTeX code
#' after the document has been knit. The modifications ensure correct
#' referencing of the appendices throughout the document. References are
#' injected into the LaTeX code in `x`. The LaTeX macros injected prior to
#' each appendix/section/subsection/subsubsection are 'newcounter' and
#' 'refstepcounter'`.
#'
#' @keywords internal
#'
#' @param x The LaTeX code as a vector of character strings, one for each line
#'
#' @return The modified LaTeX code as a vector of character strings, one for
#' each line
